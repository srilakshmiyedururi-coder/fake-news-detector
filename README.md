# 📰 Fake News Detector

A machine learning project designed to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).
- Vectorization using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or Deep Learning).
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing new articles.

Would you like me to tailor this README to highlight **deep learning (e.g., LSTM, BERT)** approaches, or keep it focused on **traditional ML models** like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes?
